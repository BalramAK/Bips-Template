     <p class="paraStyle1">Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. Your level of success is determined by your Discipline and Perseverance. Any kind of violence, be it mental or physical, racial comments, stealing and Public Display of Affection (PDA) etc is not encouraged. If a student is found engaged in activities like breaking school property, trading in school campus, possessing forbidden objects, misbehaving with school staff or using abusive language will result in disciplinary action. The school discipline policy aims at creating an environment in which all members of the school can live and work together in a supportive way. It aims to promote an environment in which everyone feels happy, safe and secure thus promoting good relationships and an environment conducive to learning. By sharing the expectations students are encouraged to develop self-control, a sense of regard for fellow students and a sense of pride in their school and community. One of the goals of education is self-discipline, so parents, teachers, and administrators will work with students to establish guidelines for acceptable behaviour. Appropriate action will be taken by the school administration, in consultation with the Principal, Teachers, when inappropriate behaviour of a student continues to disrupt the educational programme. Cases of persistent violations may lead to expulsion from the school. Every student will read and sign an undertaking of accepting and following school rules at the beginning of a new session every year. For teachers it is a great opportunity, to showcase the talents they have nurtured in the children, and for the parents it is a matter of great pride to watch them on stage.</p>
